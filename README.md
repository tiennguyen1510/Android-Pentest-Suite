This is my graduation thesis to work with my friend. Advisor is "Kubertu Labs".
It has a few function:

  - Pentest security for devices (all app) or 1 application.
  - Implement pentest in multiple storage.
  - Reverse application and check security about cryptography and code.
  - Exposure sensitive information if application write without not encrypt.
